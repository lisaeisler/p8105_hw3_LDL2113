## Problem 1

*Read in instacart data*

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
instacart_data = instacart
```

The dataset from Instacart reflects online grocery orders. The data
contains 15 variables and 1384617 entries describing individual product
orders. Each entry refers to a specific product ordered, assigned a
product ID and description, and further lists the time of day of the
overall grocery order in which that product was included, the number of
days since a customer’s prior grocery order, and categorizes the product
by aisle and department.

*How many aisles are there, and which aisles are most items ordered
from?*

``` r
instacart_aisle = instacart_data %>%
  select(aisle) %>%
  count(aisle, name = "n_aisle") %>%
  arrange(desc(n_aisle))
```

There are 134 aisles. Most orders are from the “Fresh Vegetables” aisle,
followed in popularity by the “Fresh Fruits” and “Packaged Vegetables
Fruits” aisles.

*Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered.*

``` r
instacart_aisle_plot = instacart_aisle %>%
  filter(n_aisle > 10000) %>%
  mutate(
    rank = rank(-n_aisle)
  )

ggplot(instacart_aisle_plot, aes(x = rank, y = n_aisle)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = aisle)) +
    labs(
      title = "Popular Aisles",
      x = "Aisle Popularity Ranking",
      y = "Number of Orders",
      caption = "Data from Instacart"
    )
```
